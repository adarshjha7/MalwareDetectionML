This Project compares **54 different features** and then trains the model on **respective ML aglorithms**(i.e. **RandomForestClassifier & DecisionTree** ),
Then compares their respective outcomes to provide optimal accuracy


Run my **COMPAREALGO.py** to get winner algorithm,
then Run my **DETECTnMITIGATE.py** to detect malicious files and quarantine them
